This post will highlight the major goals, accomplishments, shortcomings and how the project evolved over the summer.

## Goals

1. Greybus message handling on the native Posix target.
2. Interface PWM drivers from NuttX sources.
3. Documentation for the PWM driver.
4. Interface UART drivers from NuttX sources.
5. Documentation for the UART driver.

In the middle of the project, the goals were updated to incorporate a new userspace testbench which would generate greybus messages instead of `gbridge`.

## Accomplishments

1. Fixed the broken samples by rebasing Zephyr to v3.1.0 from v2.7.0 [[PR]](https://github.com/jadonk/zephyr/pull/17).
2. Support Greybus message handling on the native POSIX board in zephyr [[PR]](https://github.com/jadonk/greybus-for-zephyr/pull/6).
3. Add PWM to greybus on Zephyr [[PR]](https://github.com/jadonk/greybus-for-zephyr/pull/8).
4. Add UART to greybus on Zephyr [[PR]](https://github.com/jadonk/greybus-for-zephyr/pull/7).
5. Documentation for PWM, UART, and Greybus message transactions manually as well as with `gbridge` [here](https://harshilbhatt2001.github.io/gsoc22/).

## Shortcomings

1. PWM couuld not be tested due to two reason
    * Zephyr does not completely support `cc1352` and lacks drivers for PWM.
    * The native POSIX board does not emulate PWM. The custom driver has errors in the devicetree due to incorrect initialization.
2. UART does not work as expected upon attempting to update the configuration (baud rate, parity), with the linux host crashing.
3. The testbench does not work as expected, and results in permission errors when trying to communicate with the native POSIX application over a pseudo-terminal.
